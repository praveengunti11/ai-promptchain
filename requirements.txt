# Project dependencies inferred from `app.py` and `workflow.py`
# Core runtime
python-dotenv>=0.21.0
streamlit>=1.24.0

# LangChain + provider integration (the workflow imports ChatOpenAI)
langchain>=1.0.0
langchain-openai>=1.0.0

# LangGraph (graph runtime used by workflow)
langgraph>=0.1.0

# OpenAI python client (provider dependency)
openai>=0.27.0

# Data models
pydantic>=1.10.0

# Notes:
# - `workflow.py` imports `ChatOpenAI` from LangChain; ensure `langchain-openai` is installed
#   so the provider integration is available at runtime.
# - Remove or pin extras if you need reproducible installs. These are minimal, common
#   package names inferred from the code (adjust versions to your requirements).
